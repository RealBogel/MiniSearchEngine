# MiniSearchEngine
This Java assignment was to build a simple media search engine that mimics the basic functionality of a real-world engine like Google—indexing, ranking, and querying—applied to a dataset of books, movies, and other media. 

Objectives:
- Practice writing correct and structured Java code using compound data types
- Develop and use custom Java classes to represent complex objects
- Debug and test Java programs using JUnit

Breakdown:
- Implement indexing and ranking logic
- Build Java classes to represent media items
- Enable searching and querying via simple keyword matching
- Combine everything into a basic but functional search engine
